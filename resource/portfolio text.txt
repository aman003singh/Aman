"Hola"
I am Aman Kumar Singh, hailing  from the state of Bihar. I am presently pursuing my B.tech in Computer science and Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh University. Beside this I have also a keen interest in UI/UX Designing, Programming and Graphics Designing.




“Every person is unique in his own way” as said by the famous poet Milton. God sends everyone in this world with some potential and some noble purpose to serve.
 Now, the question is, whether or not we are aware of this special potential that we possess.

In this respect, I am quite conscious of the potential that I have. Today, I participate in various programmes and competitions and receive many awards and certifications.

Everyone has a hobby that he/she enjoys, so do I. Some of my favourite happies include Illustration, Learning New skills, Sketching and Coding. 
I also love to support the community and make it a better place and that's the reason why i have worked with various NGOs and became a part of NSS.
